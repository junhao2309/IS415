title: "Group Project: Spatial Point Pattern Analysis Application"
---

For IS415 GAA, one of our coursework is working in a group of 3 to create an application using Rshiny that can contribute to the geospatial analytics community.
\
Our group decided on the theme "Spatial Point Pattern Analysis Application" and used Seoul as our study area and motivation for building the application.\
We have also documented our progress through a separate website.

Our files related to the building and documentation of the application can be found on our group's github [here](https://github.com/IS415-GAA-G10/Geospatial-Analytics-Project-KR).
