# Welcome to IS415-Geographical Analytics and Applications

I am taking this module under Singapore Management University under the major: Data Science Analytics.
This module focuses on statistical and visualisation techniques on spatial data.
This module revolves around using R programming for its statistical and visualisation tool and uses quarto and Netlify to produce a [website](https://is415-gaa-junhao.netlify.app/).

Hands-on Exercises and In-class Exercises are what is taught in class while Take-home exercises are where I apply what I learn on real-world data sets.
