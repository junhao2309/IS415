Welcome to IS415 Geospatial Analytics and Applications (GAA)

This is the course website of IS415 I study this term.

You will find my course work on this website.

Hands-on Exercises and In-class exercises are sections that are taught in this module.
For the Take-Home Exercises, it is where I apply what I have learnt into analyzing the given dataset.
